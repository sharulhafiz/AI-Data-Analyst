# Steps for Machine/Deep Learning for Predictions

1. **Preprocessing**
    - Data cleaning
    - Data normalization
    - Feature selection
    - Input: data.csv
    - Output: data-00-processed.csv

2. **Model Selection**
    - Choose appropriate algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks)
    - Consider model complexity and interpretability

3. **Model Training**
    - Data bootstrapping: data-01-bootstrapped.csv
    - Data splitting (train/test)
    - Train the model using the training dataset
    - Optimize hyperparameters
    - Use cross-validation to prevent overfitting
    - Model: model.pickel/.h

4. **Model Evaluation**
    - Load model: model.pickel/.h
    - Evaluate the model using the test dataset
    - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

5. **Model Tuning**
    - Fine-tune the model based on evaluation results
    - Adjust hyperparameters and retrain if necessary
    - Save model: model-tuned.pickel

6. **Prediction**
    - Use the trained model to make predictions on new data
    - Ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data
    - Data: data-03-predicted.csv

7. **Deployment**
    - Deploy the model to a production environment
    - Monitor model performance and update as needed

8. **Maintenance**
    - Regularly retrain the model with new data
    - Monitor for model drift and performance degradation
